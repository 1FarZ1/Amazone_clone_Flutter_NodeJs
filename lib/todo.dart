// think for a solution for the rating bug, maybe you will redesign the whole system, i think this issue can be sovled with creating a global provider for rating i can not change it right now
// gix the problem with _id
// i should change the routes design , like for admin it should  admin/posts , admin/orders , its better
// i know that all-orders and sales should be seperated but i think its better to put them in one page because its not a big deal
